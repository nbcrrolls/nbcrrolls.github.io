In  ventricular myocytes, invaginations of the cell surface membrane, known as t-tubules, promote rapid propagation of the electrical signal (i.e. action potential) in the cell interior that is essential for efficient cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Alterations in the t-tubule micro-anatomy and Ca2+ flux distribution and density are recognized to be the primary mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in a diverse range of common pathologies including cardiac arrhythmias and hypertrophy.

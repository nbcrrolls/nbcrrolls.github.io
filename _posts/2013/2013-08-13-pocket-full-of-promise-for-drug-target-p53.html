Cancer remains the second leading cause of death, after heart diseases, in the US, and millions of people die from different types of cancer worldwide each year. The known tumor suppressor protein p53 is an important regulator of cell growth in normal cells and its dysfunction is closely related to tumor development and progression. Frequently tumor cells contain a mutated p53 protein that reduces or abolishes p53 anti-tumor activities. One of the current small molecules called PRIMA-1 (APR-246, aprea.com) has been shown to reactivate p53 activity and induce cell death preferentially in tumor cells.<br />

In spite of several decades of research, scientists have been unable to describe in rigorous quantitative terms the exact sequence of events that leads to activation of Protein Kinase A (PKA) by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). But a research team at UCSD will soon publish results that explain this mechanism for a PKA isoform essential for proper functioning of the heart.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://nbcr.ucsd.edu">NBCR</a> and<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a> are proud to co-sponsor a <strong>Hands-on AMBER molecular dynamics workshop</strong> Dec 15-18, 2014 at UCSD.<br />
Come learn both basic techniques, such as how to run molecular dynamics with AMBER's NVIDIA GPU code and how to use VMD to visualize AMBER trajectories, as well as more advanced topics, such as how to use BioKepler workflows for your MD runs and explore advanced sampling techniques such as Accelerated Molecular Dynamics (aMD).
